# 💻 PowerShell-Fundamentals-Lab 🧪

This repository documents my hands-on journey learning PowerShell from the ground up. It is divided into **three progressive phases**, beginning with system discovery and ending with a capstone project. All commands and scripts are **beginner-safe** and crafted for real-world, practical experience.
